This directory is meant to retain options that are required for deployment of your project to
a PAS instance. Note that CATALINA_BASE is your PAS server instance's directory.

THESE SHOULD BE DEPLOYED BEFORE THE FIRST START OF YOUR PAS INSTANCE!

Conf/ - Primary configuration directory for Spark toolkit services.
        Files in this directory should be copied to CATALINA_BASE/conf/spark by default.
Conf/Realm - Specific configuration options for use with OERealm security.
             The SparkRealm.cp should be copied to CATALINA_BASE/common/lib (per Tomcat rules)
             The SparkRealm.json should be copied to CATALINA_BASE/conf or CATALINA_BASE/conf/spark

Within the "Conf" directory, be sure to read the accompanying README files for any customizations!

If you wish to provide a different configuration directory than /spark for your PAS instance, the
framework supports use of session startup procedure parameters in the form of a JSON object, with
a property of "ConfigDir" set to the name of your specific subdirectory under the /conf folder.
For example, this option will utilize /conf/DynSports instead:
    sessionStartupProcParam={"ConfigDir": "DynSports"}

Note: Build/ Contains management scripts for start/stop/restart actions. Used primarily by PDSOE.

/*********************************************************************************************/

To add the necessary components for the Progress Modernization Framework for OpenEdge (Spark),
copy the files in the project /AppServer directory to your CATALINA_BASE/openedge folder. This
is a default, shared location among all of your webapps that will be deployed to this instance.
Files that may be included with this folder include:
    startup.pf - A simple parameter file for database options and extra configuration options.
    Ccs.pl - A procedure library that contains the Common Component Specification interfaces.
    Spark.pl - A procedure library that contains all default Spark classes (default framework).


As an example for quick-merging properties within a PAS environment, you can use the file
"merge.openedge.properties" and the following command to merge into the PAS instance:

    CATALINA_BASE\bin\oeprop -f CATALINA_BASE\openedge\merge.openedge.properties


/*********************************************************************************************/

Additionally, the following values may be useful to modify within your PASOE instance:

bin/openedge_setenv.bat (add below other JAVA_OPTS options):

    rem set network to ipv4 only
    set _oeopts=%_oeopts% -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true


conf/catalina.properties (adds common property for access log):

    # LogValve properties
    psc.as.accesslog.attribute=oemanager


conf/catalina.properties (adjust list of compressible file types):

    psc.as.compress.min=256
    psc.as.compress.types=text/html,text/xml,text/javascript,text/css,application/json,application/javascript


conf/server.xml (replace existing AccessLogValve options):

    <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve"
           directory="${catalina.base}/logs"
           prefix="localhost_access_log."
           suffix=".txt"
           conditionUnless="${psc.as.accesslog.attribute}"
           pattern="%a %t %S %I %l %u %H %m %U %s %b %D" />

    <!--
        Where the pattern is derived from the following documentation:
        https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/api/org/apache/catalina/valves/AccessLogValve.html
        %a - Remote IP address
        %t - Date and time, in Common Log Format format
        %S - User session ID
        %I - current Request thread name (can compare later with stacktraces)
        %l - Remote logical username from identd (always returns '-')
        %u - Remote user that was authenticated
        %H - Request protocol
        %m - Request method
        %U - Requested URL path
        %s - HTTP status code of the response
        %b - Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers, or '-' if no bytes were sent
        %D - Time taken to process the request, in milliseconds
    -->

    Another alternative is to add an Extended Access Log Valve:

    <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.ExtendedAccessLogValve"
           directory="${catalina.base}/logs"
           prefix="localhost_access_ext."
           suffix=".log"
           conditionUnless="${psc.as.accesslog.attribute}"
           pattern="c-ip time x-H(requestedSessionIdValid) x-H(requestedSessionId) x-H(requestedSessionIdFromCookie) cs-method cs-uri sc-status bytes time-taken cs(cookie) cs(set-cookie)" />
